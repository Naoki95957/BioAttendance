# These are some self-notes and rough brainstorm draft for what I forsee

### Options for databases:
 - MQTT
 - Firebase
 - MySQL (if I can find it [I really don't wanna write an api])

### Todo:
 - File writing to spiffs/fatfs
 - File 'getting' or client downloading csv
 - Get 2 jst connectors to run the fingerprint reader
 - Experiment and get comfy with the reader
 - Translate ID to student IDs
 - Get a time stamp (rtc or wifi; possibly a manual punch from phone in ap?)
 - Make a better web interface (as fluid as possible [reset to root/subtree URL after each request?])
